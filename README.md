# AI - Alternate Reality (AIAR)

## 🌌 Overview
AI - Alternate Reality (AIAR) is a groundbreaking AI-driven Synthetic Universe Simulator that creates and evolves an alternate reality. Using AI models like Deepseek R1 1.5B, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), and Reinforcement Learning, AIAR generates societies, ecosystems, and dynamic events. The universe evolves unpredictably, shaped by AI decision-making, emergent behaviors, and adaptive physics.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI Agents:** Independent species and civilizations that adapt and evolve.
- **Evolving Physics:** AI dynamically modifies the laws of physics using PINNs.
- **Historical Simulation:** AI generates evolving histories and civilizations.
- **Emergent Societies:** Complex interactions such as trade, diplomacy, and warfare.
- **Persistent Memory:** The universe state is stored using JSON, ensuring continuity.

    ```

## 🛎️ Usage
Run the simulation using:
```bash
python main.py
```
- The simulation state will be saved in `universe_state.json`.
- You can adjust simulation parameters in `config.py`.

## ⚙️ Configuration
Modify `config.py` to customize:
- Number of agents and species.
- Environmental factors like climate variability.
- Starting physics parameters.

## 🚦 Future Enhancements
- Expandable AI behavior with more complex decision-making.
